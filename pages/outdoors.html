                            When I was sent home from college due to COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, I took the long way home 
                            from Southern California to Washington, visiting the Mighty 5 National Parks in Utah along with 
                            3 National Monuments and 2 State Parks on a 13 day road trip, hiking, camping, climbing, running, and 
                            photographing along the way.     
                        </p>

                            In August 2019, I tackled my first bike touring trip, cycling 400 miles over 5 days from 
                            Tokyo to Joetsu to Niigata to Sado Island. Though I was ill prepared, having barely biked
                            over the past few years, using a borrowed bike, and not having a route planned, I loved every
                            minute of it, from the beautiful rivers and coastlines, the long climbs and epic descents 
                            through the mountains, and the super friendly and helpful people!

                            Having climbed Mount Fuji many times that summer, in August 2019 several friends and I 
                            decided to run, walk, and hike Mount Fuji from sea to summit, starting at the coast and 
                            climbing to the highest point in Japan in one go, covering more than a marathon in distance
                            and climbing more than 12,000ft! I would love to go back and try to set 
                            a Fastest Known Time on the route in the future!

                            During the summer of 2019, I worked as a bilingual guide for Fuji Mountain Guides
                            leading international guests on one- and two-day trips to the summit of Mount Fuji. 
                            Getting to work with amazing guides, meet so many interesting guests, and climb this
                            iconic mountain many times made for one of the most fun and rewarding summers of my life!

                            In August 2018, I backpacked the Loowit Trail that circumnavigates Mount Saint Helens 
                            with a high school friend. The geography and flora of the mountain is extremely diverse, 
                            with lush forests and rivers, large volcanic rock fields, and the barren moonscape caused by 
                            the recent eruption in 1980. I would love to go back someday, and maybe even run it in a day!
